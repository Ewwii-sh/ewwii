# Configuration & Syntax

This section introduces the foundational systems that define how you configure your UI, express logic, and work with dynamic data in Rahi (Ewwii's configuration language).

The configuration model is imparative by nature but will be used in a declarative format that is made to make configuring ewwii easy as well as to provide a logical way of configuring. You'll also work with special built in functions and modules that expose live system state and other information.

We'll cover:

-   The structure of configuration files
-   Embedding expressions within properties and attributes
-   Accessing and using built-in variables
-   Interpolation, scoping, and reactivity rules

> If you're coming from EWW's Yuck, expect similarities in structure but with much more flexibility and logical programming.
