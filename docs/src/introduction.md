# Ewwii - Widgets for everyone!

Ewwii (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets improved interface, pronounced with sufficient amounts of disgust)
is a widget system made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
which lets you create your own widgets similarly to how you can in AwesomeWM.
The key difference: It is independent of your window manager!

Ewwii is configured in [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/) and themed using [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) or [SCSS](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(style_sheet_language)>), it is easy to customize and is powerful and dynamic. The main goal of Ewwii is to make configuration easy and to give the user all the power that they need.
