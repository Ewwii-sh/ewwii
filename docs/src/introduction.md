# Ewwii - Widgets for everyone made easy!

Ewwii (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets improved interface)
is a widget system made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
which lets you create your own widgets similarly to how you can in AwesomeWM.
The key difference: It is independent of your window manager!

Ewwii is configured in [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/)
and themed using [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
or [SCSS](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(style_sheet_language)>),
it is easy to customize and is powerful and dynamic.
The main goal of Ewwii is to make configuration easy
and to give the user all the power that they need.

Rhai is not just a basic markup language. It is a full embeddable scripting language!
This makes ewwii's configuration even more flexible and powerful.

Ewwii is built for users who want:

-   Easy configuration syntax
-   Built-in configuration libraries
-   Powerful expression and [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)
-   Fully customizable widget-based UIs
-   Dynamic interfaces that respond to system state

Whether you're building a tiling-friendly status bar, a floating dashboard, or a themed control panel, Ewwii gives you the tools to design it, script it, and make it your own.
