# Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of your interface. Each widget represents a visual element—text, images, containers, interactive components—that can be composed, styled, and updated dynamically.

This section introduces:

-   The basic anatomy of a widget definition
-   How widgets are laid out within windows
-   The attributes and properties available to each widget type
-   Patterns for building reusable or dynamic widget trees

You’ll also learn how widget properties interact with the expression language and how reactivity is handled across updates.
