# Theming & UI

This section focuses on visual styling and user interface customization. The core visual layer is built atop GTK, allowing deep integration with system themes while also enabling custom overrides through SCSS-style syntax.

We'll explore:

-   How GTK theming works under the hood
-   Styling your widgets using theme classes and custom CSS
-   Layout implications of theme decisions (e.g., spacing, margins, z-order)

Whether you're trying to match your system's look or building a highly customized UI, this section gives you the tools to style confidently.
